# Brackets Technical Interview Question

  

During a technical interview I was asked to write some psuedo code for how to determine if a string composed of brackets is "balanced"*

``* balanced meaning, it opened and closed brackets in the same order, e.g (([[{}]]))``

I got home and decided to write out a coded solution that verifies if a string of brackets is balanced.
